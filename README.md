# SecureDrop Worskatation Keyring (RPM)

This repository contains the material needed to bootstrap a SecureDrop
Workstation installation - a .repo file and the SecureDrop signing key.

The production package is meant to be hosted in qubes-contrib.

The repository also contains the .spec file for a test keyring package,
not to be packaged on qubes-contrib, but to be used instead by
SecureDrop Workstation developers and CI in their dev/testing workflows.

**At the moment this repo is experimental and should not be part of a production SDW installation.**
